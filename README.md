# NBA Stats Analysis

This was my final project for Math 50, Introduction to Linear Models, which I took in Fall of 2022. My three partners and I looked at data from the 2017-2022 seasons of the NBA to evaluate which statistics, or predictors, were most common amongst winning teams. 

The code used can be found in the jupyter notebook file called `Stat Analysis.ipynb`, and the write-up of the project can be found in the project writeup file, `Project Writeup.pdf`.
